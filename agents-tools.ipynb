Different ranking systems exist (like FIFA rankings, Elo ratings, etc.), and their methodologies vary, leading to different results.  Furthermore, team performance fluctuates throughout the season and across different competitions.  A team might dominate one tournament but underperform in another.  Therefore, declaring one team definitively 'the best' is subjective and depends heavily on the criteria used for evaluation.  To illustrate, a team might have a superior record in a particular league but lack success in international competitions.
